          <h5 class="card-title text-success fw-bold">🎯 Good Portfolio</h5>
          <ul class="card-text">
            <li><b>Competitions</b></li>
            <p class="card-text">Showcase your best academic and extracurricular achievements that reflect your strengths and goals. Highlight awards, rankings, or leadership roles in science fairs, debate tournaments, math olympiads, or robotics competitions. Quality matters more than quantity — focus on depth, impact, and personal growth.</p>
            <li><b>Social Activities</b></li>
            <p class="card-text">Engage in meaningful community service, clubs, or leadership roles that demonstrate your values and initiative. Whether you founded a student club, led a charity drive, or volunteered consistently over years, emphasize how these experiences shaped your perspective, developed your soft skills, and contributed to your community.</p>
            <li><b>Summer Schools</b></li>
            <p class="card-text">Participate in reputable academic programs or internships to deepen your knowledge, gain new skills, and show intellectual curiosity. Choose programs aligned with your intended major — whether it’s a STEM research camp, a humanities seminar at an Ivy League university, or a global business internship. Document what you learned, who you collaborated with, and how the experience clarified your academic or career path.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title text-success fw-bold">📚 Academic Performance</h5>
          <ul class="card-text">
            <li>Maintain a high GPA</li>
            <p class="card-text">Aim for consistent excellence throughout high school. Admissions committees look for upward trends and rigor — challenge yourself with honors, AP, IB, or A-Level courses when possible. Your GPA is a core indicator of your work ethic and ability to handle university-level academics.</p>
            <li>Achieve a strong SAT score</li>
            <p class="card-text">Aim for a score above the 75th percentile for your target schools. Prepare strategically using official practice tests, tutoring if needed, and time management techniques. Remember, while scores matter, they’re part of a holistic review — don’t let one test define your potential. To practice SAT tasks use next website: <a href="https://1600.lol/" target="_blank">https://1600.lol/</a>. To practice full-length SAT use college board's official app: Bluebook</p>
            <li>Reach a high IELTS band (7.0+ recommended)</li>
            <p class="card-text">For non-native English speakers, a strong IELTS score demonstrates your readiness to succeed in an English-speaking academic environment. Focus on all four sections — listening, reading, writing, and speaking — and consider retaking the test if needed to reach your target. Many top universities require 7.0 or higher for admission.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title text-success fw-bold">✍️ Essay</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Write a personal and reflective essay that highlights your goals, character, and motivation to study abroad. Use vivid storytelling to reveal who you are beyond grades and scores. Share a defining moment, a challenge you overcame, or a passion that drives you. Be authentic, specific, and forward-looking — explain why you want to study in a particular country or program, and how it aligns with your long-term aspirations. Let your voice shine through — admissions officers want to get to know the real you.</p>
